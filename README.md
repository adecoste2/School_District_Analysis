# School District Analysis Challenge

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the student testing data for ninth grade students at Thomas High School. The reason for a segmented analysis on Thomas High School's ninth grade student's grade data is that the students_complete.csv file that was supplied by the school board for previous analysis has been marked as suspect of academic dishonesty in regards to the ninth grade reading and math grades for Thomas High School. Therefore, to uphold state-testing standards this analysis will replace Thomas High School's math and reading scores with NaN values while keepiing the rest of the data intact. After replacing Thomas High School's math and reading scores with NaN values the initial analysis on was repeated to obtain math and reading scores, passing averages and passing percentages for charter and district high schools in the school board's district.
